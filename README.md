## Target Lock (alpha)

![Foundry Version](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://foundryshields.com/version?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillNichols726/target-lock/release/module.json)

Target Lock is a Foundry VTT module for Pathfinder 2e that lists all targeted tokens when an actor makes a damage roll. Target lock makes it easy for GM's to easily apply damage to the tokens their players have targeted by inserting damage buttons into the damage roll result message.

Note: My development environment is still on 0.8.9 because I still have some content built out that I need to run for my players. Once I migrate to 0.9.x, my plan is to circle back around and get a new version of this out.
